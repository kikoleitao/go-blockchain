# Simple Blockchain in Go

## Overview

This project is a simple blockchain implementation in Go, developed in two stages:

- **Part 1**: A basic blockchain structure linking blocks via hashes.
- **Part 2**: Adding Proof-of-Work (PoW) to secure block creation.

## Part 1: Basic Prototype

### Features

- A `Block` structure containing data, its hash, and the hash of the previous block.
- A `BlockChain` structure managing a list of blocks.
- A genesis block that starts the chain.
- Basic functionality to add new blocks linked through hashes.

Each block's hash is generated using SHA-256 over its `Data` and `PrevHash`.

### How It Works

- The blockchain is initialized with a **genesis block** (`"Genesis"` data).
- New blocks are added manually by calling `AddBlock(data)`, which:
  - References the previous block's hash.
  - Computes its own hash.
  - Appends the block to the chain.
- When run, the program prints the data, previous hash, and hash of each block in the chain.

### How to Run

```bash
# Initialize the Go module
go mod init github.com/kikoleitao/go-blockchain

# Run the main program
go run main.go
```

### Example Output (Part 1)

```bash
Previous Hash:
Data in Block: Genesis
Hash: 81ddc8d248b2dccdd3fdd5e84f0cad62b08f2d10b57f9a831c13451e5c5c80a5
Previous Hash: 81ddc8d248b2dccdd3fdd5e84f0cad62b08f2d10b57f9a831c13451e5c5c80a5
Data in Block: First Block after Genesis
Hash: 50493b76a2b7bec8d33620d6310d5578b1dda079684405ed5e6bd55510146daf
Previous Hash: 50493b76a2b7bec8d33620d6310d5578b1dda079684405ed5e6bd55510146daf
Data in Block: Second Block after Genesis
Hash: 213e91a4ae1be45a651695ede0e75cba50818dce027dd4f0fe35742dc90158e1
Previous Hash: 213e91a4ae1be45a651695ede0e75cba50818dce027dd4f0fe35742dc90158e1
Data in Block: Third Block after Genesis
Hash: e22b76962d23ed3e327b9ababac19270b56c4d70d8878446609b13fa72ebc0e1
```

## Part 2: Adding Proof-of-Work

### New Features

- Each block must satisfy a **Proof-of-Work** (PoW) before being added.
- A block is only valid if its hash is smaller than a target defined by a **difficulty** level.

### How Difficulty Works

- `Difficulty = 20` means that the hash must start with around **20 leading binary zeros**.
- In hexadecimal output, this looks like **5 leading zeros**.
- Technically, the valid hash must be **smaller than** `2^(256 - Difficulty)`.

Example:
```bash
Difficulty = 20
Target = 2^236
```

- Hashes are generated by iteratively incrementing a `nonce` until a valid hash is found.
- This process proves that **computational work** was done to mine the block.

### Example Output (Part 2)

```bash
Data in Block: Genesis
